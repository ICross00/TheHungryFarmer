Now that you have created a new layer (click on a component and find the layers in the top right of the screen), you can stop the player from going specific places.

1) Click in the tile palet (drawing the map) and make sure 'Active Tilemap' is set to 'Collision'.
2) Choose a tile and draw on the scene where you do not want the player to go.
3) The player should now be blocked from going where the tiles you did.
4) To make the tile invisible, Under inpector: make sure the 'Tilemap Renderer' is not ticked.


NOTE: Two parts the house will need top be added. A section that will be collidable and a section the player can move behind.
