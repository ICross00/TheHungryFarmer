/*
This class spawns a collectable at its location, then destroys itself
This is useful if you want to add a collectable to a scene without writing a script to spawn it in

To use this class, create an empty game object and add this script to it as a component. Then, in the inspector,
select which item you would like it to spawn and enter the stack amount.
